        <br><br><br>
        <h3>NAME</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Martin Ivan C. Dalangin</p>
        <br>
        <h3>NICKNAME</h3>
        <p>You can call me Martin for short</p>

        <h3>FAV CMSC SUBJECT SO FAR</h3>
        <p>So far my favorite subject has been CMSC 150. This is really an unusual choice since i know that most of my friends dislike this subject since its exercises are really hard to finish especially if we were to accomplish them within laboratory hours during face-to-face classes. However, I really enjoyed CMSC 150 the most since it involved a lot of mathematics and calculus which I was really interested in. Moreover, learning CMSC 150 gave me a picture of what it would be like to study data science in the future which is what I am aiming to do in the future. Along with this, it was actually very satisying to do and explore the programs we were asked to do in our CMSC 150 laboratory exercises which made me really enjoy the course.</p>

        <h3>FAV GE SO FAR</h3>
        <p>My favorite GE subject so far has been HIST 1. I loved HIST 1 because it made me learn about the rich history that our country has had. This broadened my knowledge with regards to the culture of the early Filipino civilization and at the same time my professor was very enthusiastic. Most of all, I loved this GE the most since it really boosted my Filipino pride and made me more motivated to give back to this country in the future.</p>

        <h3>FAV PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SO FAR</h3>
        <p>Given that my favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 150, my favorite programming language has to be R programming language. The syntax of R for me has been relatively easy to get used to since it is quite similar to Java. Moreocer, it was amazing for me how I could form my own mathematical functions using R and at the same time evaluate these expressions in order to predict a trend given a set of data points which was really cool for me. </p>
